Images issue:
if i download an image that is big...4500*3500.  I want it to be a background image and appear on my page with a width of 100% but I also want to see the whole picture.

The first thing i did was resize the image (proportionally).
In my css I added it as a background image and background-size cover

#module1{
    background-image: url('../images/flowerImage.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
    height: 80vh;
}

This was not good for me because it cut off the bottom of the image.

I then kept making the image smaller and smaller proportionally.  And while the smaller the image the more of it I see, i am looking for a better to do this.

I've gotten comfortable with cropping and resizing images, but I don't know what the right size or calculations should be so that it can be shown crisp on big and small monitors with 100% width.
